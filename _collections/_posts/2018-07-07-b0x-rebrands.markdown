Founded and developed by a world-class team of industry experts, b0x, the leading decentralized margin trading protocol, has rebranded ahead of the imminent launch to the mainnet. Tom Bean, co-founder and CEO, revealed that b0x will henceforth be known as bZx to further distinguish its brand identity.

>“We wanted to make the zero-x aspect of our identity clear and prevent confusion with any companies or protocols named Box.” — Tom Bean, CEO

>“While we were attached to the b0x name and brand, we were not prepared to go to court with any companies claiming rights to the name. Our legal concern was more than theoretical. There are thousands of companies claiming trademark rights over the term “box” and we had inadvertently stepped into a legal minefield.“ — Kyle J Kistner, CVO

bZx has launched its full site to reflect its new identity as it prepares to release to the mainnet on July 10th. Unlike most blockchain startups, bZx has made the ethical decision not to offer its tokens to the public without a fully functional platform. This is an almost unprecedented development in an industry where a majority of offerings are based on whitepapers and MVPs are still considered a novelty.

## With Mainnet Approaching, DEX Liquidity is Coming

Traders and lenders have emerged as the most critical pillar of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. These influential stakeholders require secure and frictionless infrastructure to exchange and liquidate assets. However, these parties are often forced to compromise between highly limited decentralized exchanges and the unsafe centralized exchanges.
With the recent spate of high profile hacks on centralized exchanges, non-custodial decentralized exchanges (DEX) offer the best possible security for traders. Instead of a centralized orderbook and fund management system, DEXs facilitate cryptocurrency trading directly on the blockchain, giving users total control of their funds and wallet, while ensuring that nobody controls the funds of users.

The current crop of DEXs have gone a long way in improving upon the clunky interfaces and resource requirements of the previous generation. However, DEXs continue to fall short of the seamless and user-friendly experiences of centralized exchanges. This has left traders with no choice but to continue exposing their funds to risks, while lenders miss out on lucrative interest due to the absence of margin lending infrastructure on these decentralized exchanges. This is now coming to an end.
