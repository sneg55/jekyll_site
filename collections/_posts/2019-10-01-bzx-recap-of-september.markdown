We have tons of updates, but we don’t always condense it in a bite-sized form. Our community is dizzy at the pace of new updates and it can be hard to keep up, so we want to introduce you to a new format in our blog: monthly recaps. Each month we are going to publish a short breakdown of what’s done and achieved.
Without further ado here it is:

## Torque release
Released the first version of [Torque](https://torque.loans), our ENS-enabled borrowing that lets you get into a loan as easily as sending ETH to dai.tokenloan.eth. Web3 support coming in October.

## gDAI

CryptoManiacs builds [gDAI](https://devpost.com/software/gdai) on Fulcrum, creating an interest yielding DAI that pays for its own gas with interest. gDAI enables sending DAI without paying for gas with Ether by using gas station network and staking on Fulcrum for earning interest for further transactions. CryptoManiacs win a prize at [ETHBoston](https://ethboston.devpost.com/) hackathon with this project. Congrats!
