Last year we debuted to the public at ETHDenver. It was our first BUIDLATHON and first official event. Since then we have attended others, but none has so special a place in our heart as ETHDenver. There is something truly special about the conference that you need to see to believe. The organizers work tirelessly to make every aspect of the conference perfect, and it really shows. ETHDenver is free for everyone wanting to participate, so make sure to [apply](https://www.ethdenver.com/) as their last round of applications closes January 31, 2019.

## Looking Back at ETHDenver 2018

When we came to ETHDenver last year we had been working in stealth for the prior five months, getting our contracts ready to launch to the testnet, developing our portal dApp, and writing our developer library bZx.js. We weren’t quite ready to have production ready applications built on top of our protocol, but we were excited to get folks tinkering around with what we were building and to start building interest. We couldn’t have asked for a better place to debut our project.

## ETHDenver 2019

Our protocol is now on the mainnet, we’re integrating with over half a dozen 0x relays, and our [developer documentation](https://bzx.network/docs/) is ready for consumption. We attended ETHSingapore in December 2018 and had developers building on our protocol. Our favorite project to come out of that Hackathon was [t-bZx](https://devpost.com/software/t0x-g1vlaf), a Telegram bot for [0x](https://0x.org/) and [bZx](http://bzx.network/) that allowed users to send digital assets and take out margin loans using just the Telegram client. We found this to be a very interesting project in terms of user onboarding, as it didn’t require users to create a wallet or download any specialized software such as Metamask to start using 0x and bZx.

This year at ETHDenver, we’re looking forward to having many developers build a variety of projects on top of bZx. During ETHSingapore we [released a wishlist](https://medium.com/bzxnetwork/ethsingapore-wishlist-and-bounty-6d0b1b1d3ad2) detailing a wide variety of possible projects that could be built on top of the protocol. These include 0x Relays, Kyber Relays, Dark Pools, and more, all with margin trading functionality.

## Getting In Touch

If you are a hacker looking to start building on bZx during ETHDenver, we recommend looking through our contracts on [Github](https://github.com/bzxnetwork) and reading our [Developer Docs](https://bzx.network/docs/). There you will find documentation on both our contracts and our bZx.js library that is intended to help relays integrate. For developers looking to build on top of an existing relay and take advantage of the trading functionality of bZx, we recommend reading through the [bZx Standard Relayer API](https://sra.bamboorelay.com/) created by [BambooRelay](https://bamboorelay.com/).
Before the conference, you can stop by our [Telegram group](https://t.me/b0xNet) to ask any questions you might have about the protocol. Feel free to send Tom Bean (@tcb101) a private message for any questions directly relating to code. During the conference, both co-founders Tom Bean and Kyle J Kistner will be attending. Come find us at our booth and ask any questions you might have.
