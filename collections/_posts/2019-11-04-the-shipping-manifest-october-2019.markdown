## CoinGecko Report Feature

The [latest Coingecko Report](https://assets.coingecko.com/reports/2019-Q3-Report/CoinGecko-2019-Q3-Report.pdf) featured Fulcrum and Torque. If you haven’t checked this report yet — we highly recommend doing so. There is an excellent explanation of the current DeFi ecosystem.

Structured is one of the coolest products built with Ethereum money legos we’ve seen yet. It builds on Fulcrum, Synthetix, Kyber, Uniswap, and Compound to create some really unique new financial products.

## dDAI Builds on Fulcrum
[dDAI](https://ddai.netlify.com/) enables users to earn interests from lending out DAI on Fulcrum and reinvest those interest automatically into any other asset class using DeFi recipes, i.e., ETH, BTX, KNC, synthetic assets, etc. or a combination of different assets.

What does ETH Maximalist Zap do?

Your deposit is automatically split between bZx Perpetual Short WBTC (dsWBTC) and bZx Perpetual Long ETH-DAI 2x(dLETH2x).

For example, if you send 1 ETH to ETH Maximalist Zap’s Smart Contract address:
- 0.5 of your ETH will go towards opening a Perpetual (without expiration) BTC Short position on Fulcrum exchange.
- and 0.5 ETH will be used to open a Perpetual ETH Long with 2x leverage. This means you will have exposure to 1 ETH (0.5x2).

## Portle Builds on Fulcrum
[Portle](https://devpost.com/software/portle) provides an interface to interact with several dapp protocols under a single user interface. It presents those protocols under categories that are inherited from the banking application to make an experience more familiar.
