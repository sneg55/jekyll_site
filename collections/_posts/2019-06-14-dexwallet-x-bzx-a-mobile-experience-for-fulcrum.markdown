Dexwallet in collaboration with bZx have created a mobile native integration of [Fulcrum](https://fulcrum.trade/), the first tokenized margin lending and trading platform on Ethereum. Using Fulcrum, users can earn passive income on their cryptocurrency holdings and receive iTokens which can be used as collateral for loans. Imagine [earning interest while taking out a loan](https://medium.com/bzxnetwork/bzx-makerdao-9db74678e16e) via a MakerDAO CDP. These are the cutting edge financial applications that Dexwallet seeks to support.

Onboarding users directly through wallets and turning their accounts into an interest bearing unBank account is an important facet of our vision of making every single cryptocurrency holder a user of bZx. Everyone should be able to capitalize on the time value of their assets in a frictionless way.” — Kyle J Kistner, CVO @ bZx
