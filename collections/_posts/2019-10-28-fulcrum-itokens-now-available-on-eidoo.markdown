## Why Use Eidoo?
Eidoo offers a seamless mobile-native experience for earning interest on your existing digital assets, as well as the opportunity to enter in Fulcrum using a wire transfer (fiat-on ramp) to buy DAI or exchange them in the atomic swap selling ETH. More than that, it is a one-stop-shop for trading, lending, and interacting with the most powerful DeFi primitives from a single polished interface.

## What are iTokens?
![](/images/itokens.png)

iTokens, such as iDAI or iUSDC, are interest accumulating tokens that continuously go up in value as you hold them. They represent a share in a lending pool that grows in size as borrowers pay interest into them. This innovative concept was first introduced to the community by bZx in a [joint post with MakerDAO](https://medium.com/bzxnetwork/bzx-makerdao-9db74678e16e) in July of 2018. Later, the technical specifications were laid out in [the article](https://medium.com/bzxnetwork/introducing-fulcrum-tokenized-margin-made-dead-simple-e65ccc82393f) announcing Fulcrum in March of 2019. iTokens can be traded, used as collateral, composed by developers into structured products, or sent to cold storage for safety.

## What is bZx?

bZx is the margin lending and trading protocol on which Fulcrum and Torque are built. [Fulcrum](http://fulcrum.trade/) is a margin lending and trading platform with tokenized loans (iTokens) and tokenized positions (pTokens) that uses algorithmic lending pools to determine interest rates through supply and demand. [Torque](http://torque.loans/) is a borrowing platform that allows ETH and ERC20s to be used as collateral for borrowing a wide variety of assets at fixed interest rates for indefinite terms. Torque can be accessed through any wallet through its ENS system, or through any web3 wallet via its [web interface](https://torque.loans/).
